# Dot Connection
A lightweight, interactive web project built for fun and practice with the HTML5 <canvas> element. On each click, it generates animated, randomized paths that mimic the structure of hexagons. 
This experiment explores grid-based drawing, recursion, and dynamic rendering logic using raw JavaScript â€” no frameworks, just the canvas API and imagination.
